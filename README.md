BypassUAC
=========

Fully functional UAC bypass for Hak5 USB rubber duck, fixes an unwanted "y" at the beginning of payload when UAC window doesnt show.


Customize delay on line 8 according to your needs.
 
 - Decerased delay value will speed payload execution, with small risk of not executing properly.

 - Increased delay value will increase chances of a successful payload.

The best method is to know your target, make as many tests as possible so you can get an average.
